# SHG Helper

## Description
The main objective of our project is to help in the conversion of the offline system of SHG to an online system with more transparency about the person creating and supervising the SHG. We propose to build an online platform through which users seeking to join a SHG can create an account and join the group which will help them in seeking loans at a lower interest rate from the pool of money collected in the group provided that they meet some minimum financial conditions and also help in prevention of delays as in the offline system where it takes people days to get registered for SHG through a Govt. entity.
